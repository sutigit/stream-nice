/**
 * useFlushedState
 * ----------------
 * A drop-in replacement for useState that forces React to flush updates synchronously.
 *
 * React 18 batches async updates for performance. In streaming or real-time UIs,
 * this can delay state propagation and cause effects to skip intermediate values.
 *
 * This hook wraps setState in ReactDOM.flushSync(), ensuring each update commits
 * and runs effects immediately â€” even inside async callbacks like streaming readers.
 *
 * Use cases:
 * - Real-time stream rendering (token-by-token updates)
 * - Measuring DOM layout right after a state change
 * - Forcing per-frame or per-chunk updates during async reads
 *
 * Trade-offs:
 * - Breaks React's batching optimizations
 * - May cause more renders per second (CPU cost)
 * - Should only be used when immediate flushes are required
 *
 * Docs:
 * https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/flushSync
